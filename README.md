# 2021-07-06-pyhep-uproot-awkward-tutorial

Tutorials for the PyHEP Uproot Awkward Array tutorial presented on July 7, 2021.

See the [event page for videoconferencing details](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019958/timetable/#20210705.detailed) (search on page for "Uproot and Awkward").

## How to participate

Run the JupyterLab code with us, altering examples and asking "what if" questions along the way.

The preferred way to run these notebooks is through a public cloud service called Binder:

  </a>
</p>

Note that Binder may take a minute or two to start up.

## Running everything on your own computer

This course will not cover installation of the software, but everything can be installed with pip or conda, standard mechanisms for installing Python packages. See [environment.yml](environment.yml) for a list of package names and versions.

## Browsing the material online

The cells of the JupyterLab notebooks are deliberately unevaluatedâ€”we will discover their output during the tutorial. However, if you're coming here after the event and want to look up how we did something, see the [evaluated](evaluated) directory for an evaluated version of the notebook.
